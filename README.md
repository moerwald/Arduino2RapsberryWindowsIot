Describes how to connect an Arduino Uno with a raspberry pi2, and read a analog value.


I found a lot of tutorials explaining how to connect an Arduino with Raspberry Pi2 (using [firmata] (https://github.com/firmata/protocol)), and toggling same LED outputs. I had a [TMP36] (https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sik-experiment-guide-for-arduino---v32/experiment-7-reading-a-temperature-sensor) temperature sensor, and wanted to visualize the appropriate values via an UWP app.

Below sections shell help other makers facing the same or similar problem.
