Describes how to connect an Arduino Uno with a raspberry pi2, and read a analog value.

I found a lot of tutorials explaining how to connect an Arduino with Raspberry Pi2 (using [https://github.com/firmata/protocol](firmata)), and toggling same LED outputs. But none of them explained how to setup a analog input, and read values from it.
